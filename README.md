This was the output of my tinkering with [react][react], [redux][redux], [redux-saga][saga] and [Google's Firestore][firestore] to create a Todo App with Realtime Functionalities which was based on [Dan Abramov's Tutorial in egghead.io][egghead.io].

I highly recommend the tutorial for beginners of redux. Best of all **ITS FREE**.

This was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
